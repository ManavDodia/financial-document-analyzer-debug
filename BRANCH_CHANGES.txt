Summary of changes made on this branch vs main (detailed)

1) tools.py
 - Added environment loading (python-dotenv).
 - Made PyPDFLoader import optional with try/except; handle missing langchain-community gracefully.
 - Implemented a lazy _search_wrapper that imports/instantiates SerperDevTool only when needed; stopped instantiating SerperDevTool at module import time.
 - Implemented read_financial_pdf(path) function: saves/reads PDF via PyPDFLoader (handles load/load_and_split variations), cleans text via _clean_text, returns diagnostic strings when file/loader unavailable or errors occur.
 - Implemented analyze_investment_data(data) placeholder function (deterministic skeleton).
 - Implemented create_risk_assessment(data) placeholder function (deterministic skeleton).
 - Added _clean_text helper (normalize whitespace, collapse extra newlines).
 - Exported all tools as plain Python dicts (name, func, description) to avoid CrewAI/langchain coercion issues and Pydantic/BaseTool instantiation problems.
 - Added a fallback search_tool dict when crewai_tools.SerperDevTool is unavailable.

2) agents.py
 - Added missing os import and load_dotenv().
 - Removed direct dependency on OpenAI ChatOpenAI in final branch (we added Groq option).
 - Added robust handling for LLM provider:
    - Attempt to use langchain_groq (if installed).
    - If not available, provide a GroqAdapter fallback (HTTP adapter) that is instantiated only when GROQ_API_KEY present.
 - Ensured Agent objects are created with llm present; removed tool lists from Agent constructors (to avoid runtime Pydantic coercion errors).
 - Fixed model/parameter names and ensured no use of undefined variables.
 - Added minimal Agent definitions (financial_analyst, verifier, risk_assessor, etc.) using the configured llm.

3) task.py
 - Fixed numerous syntax issues (mismatched parentheses/brackets).
 - Rewrote Task definitions to:
    - Use long, explicit description and expected_output blocks (JSON templates).
    - Remove tool lists from Task constructors (to prevent coercion/abstract BaseTool instantiation at import time).
    - Ensure tasks reference the Agent objects present in agents.py.
 - Standardized naming to use the exported *_tool dicts (tools are supplied at execution time rather than forced at import).

4) main.py
 - Implemented FastAPI app skeleton with:
    - GET / health endpoint returning {"status":"ok"}.
    - POST /analyze that accepts UploadFile + query (saves uploaded file to tmp_uploads).
    - Uses read_financial_pdf_tool's "func" to extract text (calls dict["func"]).
    - Catches OpenAI/Groq API errors (e.g., RateLimit) and returns clear HTTP 5xx messages.
 - Added run_crew() stub (placeholder) to integrate Crew kickoff when LLM/tasks are ready.
 - Added guidance to run uvicorn without --reload for stable local testing when posting requests.

5) Runtime / Pydantic / BaseTool handling
 - Avoided instantiating abstract BaseTool subclasses at import time (this previously raised "Can't instantiate abstract class BaseTool" errors).
 - Standardized approach to supply tools as plain dicts to Agents/Tasks or to pass tools at Task/Crew execution time.
 - Removed earlier attempts that defined BaseTool subclasses without fully implementing required abstract methods.

6) Testing & utilities
 - Added test_post.py (renamed from import requests.py) as a scripted test client using requests; prints response code and preview.
 - Documented how to run uvicorn and the test script.
 - Addressed file-shadowing issue (don't name test files import requests.py).

7) Error handling & developer ergonomics
 - Added explicit diagnostics returned from tools when dependencies missing (e.g., "[read_financial_pdf] PyPDFLoader not available").
 - Added HTTP 503 mapping for OpenAI rate/quota errors and clearer error messages in main.py.
 - Included notes to set GROQ_API_KEY or OPENAI_API_KEY in .env / environment.

8) Dependency recommendations (not added to branch as files)
 - langchain-community (for PyPDFLoader)
 - python-dotenv
 - requests (for adapters/tests)
 - langchain-groq (or official Groq SDK) if switching LLM provider
 - crewai / crewai-tools (optional; used only if available)
 - uvicorn, fastapi

What remains / caveats
 - The analyze_investment_data and create_risk_assessment functions are placeholders and must be implemented for production analysis.
 - If you choose OpenAI instead of Groq, restore ChatOpenAI usage and ensure OPENAI_API_KEY is set; handle rate limits accordingly.
 - If you prefer BaseTool / langchain.Tool instances, implement concrete classes with annotated fields and a working _run method, and instantiate them safely (not at import time) or pass dicts to Crew/Agent as done here.
 - Confirm exact langchain_groq import/class name if you want to use the package directly; branch includes an adapter fallback to avoid import errors.
